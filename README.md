# RespecTube

RespecTube is a React app that is imitating a video streaming website but with an abuse-detection system that blocks toxic/inappropriate comments. <br>
The purpose of the app is for me to demonstrate my ability to work with APIs within a well designed App.

Disclaimer: I deployed the app on the 6th or March and am planning to refactor the code in the next weeks. 

### How to test out the app
Scroll down to the comment section, play out with the API. <br>
To try out the offensive detection, try to comment: "This music is garbage !" (you can be more imaginative here üòÅ)

## APIs Description
### Youtube API
I used the Youtube Data v3 API to get the video details (Description, number of views, video title, etc...)
<br> API Documentation: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/videos

### ParallelDots API
ParallelDots API enables the detection of abusive or hateful terms. I am using a POST axios request and get an object response with the detection results.

## Comment Section
The comments are purposefully hard-coded so I keep control on what is being displayed when the app is explored. I do not want bad surprise and it enables me to add a touch of humour. <br>
If I would have wanted to add real comments, I could have got the data using the same Youtube API.
